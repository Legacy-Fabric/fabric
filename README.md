# Legacy Rewoven API

Essential hooks for modding on 1.7.10, 1.8.9 and 1.12.2.

Legacy Rewoven API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Legacy Rewoven mods. Examples include:

- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as biomes and enchantments
- Adding events, hooks, APIs and commonly used hacks to improve interoperability between mods such as resource loading, networking and gamerules
- Adding APIs that help circumvent difficult-to-use minecraft APIs such as commands
