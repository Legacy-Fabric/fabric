# Legacy Rewoven API



Essential hooks for modding on 1.8.9 and 1.12.2.



Legacy Rewoven API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Legacy Rewoven mods. Examples include:



- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as biomes and enchantments

- Adding events, hooks, APIs and commonly used hacks to improve interoperability between mods such as resource loading, networking and gamerules

- Adding APIs that help circumvent difficult-to-use minecraft APIs such as commands
