# Legacy Fabric API

Essential hooks for modding with Fabric.

Fabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:

Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions
Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.

For support, consider joining the [Legacy Fabric discord server](https://legacyfabric.net/discord) or opening an issue.
